# OpenGL-One

This project is a simple OpenGL graphics application written in C++ that renders a square on the screen. It sets up a GLFW window for rendering, uses GLEW for OpenGL extensions handling, compiles and links vertex and fragment shaders, and renders the square using OpenGL's draw functions.

## Key Achievements

- Successfully created a GLFW window for rendering graphics.
- Utilized GLEW to manage OpenGL extensions.
- Designed and compiled vertex and fragment shaders for rendering.
- Implemented error-checking for shader compilation and OpenGL function calls.
- Developed a square using vertex and index buffers.
- Maintained the main render loop for continuous display.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you will need:

- C++ compiler
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
